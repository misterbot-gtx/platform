# Templates
Each campaign has a Handlebars template associated to it to help render the final message that is sent to the end user. Each template contains the structure of the design or message as well as placeholders for variables that will be filled in for every user that it is sent to.

## Getting Started
Parcelvoy has four different types of templates:
- Email
- Text Message
- Push Notification
- Webhooks

Each of which has fields that are rendered as Handlebars templates. They can be customized using a combination of variables and functions.

### Template Types:
#### Email
Email templates are comprised of various fields that are related to the email experience such as `subject`, `body`, `cc`, etc. Each field on the template allows you to use Handlebars to modify the end result. Additionally the `html` field is sent to the user to be rendered as HTML and will display any styles included.

#### Text Message
A text message template is largely just a single field that is broken up into pieces based on its content length. Bare in mind that any Handlebars variables that are filled in will be of variable length and could cause the total content length to grow.

#### Push Notification
Similar to text messages, a push notification is mainly just a piece of text but can also contain a JSON body as well as a title. All fields can be customized using Handlebars to include functions and variables.

#### Webhooks
Webhook templates are a wrapper around an HTTP REST request. You can customize headers and body parameters to send a request to pretty much any endpoint you can think of. The `body` and `headers` fields accept objects, but are not rendered as strings. Each key in each object is instead, so Handlebars is only interpreted at the value level of each key.

### Variables
Depending on the incoming data each template will have access to a `user` object and an optional `event` object.

They can be accessed by key and properties inside of each are accessed using dot notation.

```
{{ user.email }}
// or
{{ event.custom_property }}
```

Templates will always have access to the user, but the event property will only have a value if the template is being rendered as a result of an event triggering an action.

In general, we recommend using snake case for properties to be consistent, but there is no rule that says you cant use something else.

All user objects will at a minimum have a series of constant fields present (although they may be null) as well as any custom fields you add to the user.
```json
// User Object
{
    "id": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID",
    "email": "abc@example.com",
    "phone": "+11234567890",
    "locale": "en",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago"
}
```


## Helpers
Alongside being able to access variables using Handlebars, you can also modify values using custom helpers. We've included a list of them below.

### Equality
#### Compare
There is a general equality function `compare` which lets you check if two values match an operator. Available operators are `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`.
```handlebars
{{ compare "a" "==" "b" }}
```

#### Equals
```handlebars
{{ eq "a" "b" }}
```

#### Not Equals
```handlebars
{{ nq "a" "b" }}
```

#### Less Than
```handlebars
{{ lt "a" "b" }}
```

#### Greater Than
```handlebars
{{ gt "a" "b" }}
```

#### Less Than or Equal To
```handlebars
{{ lte "a" "b" }}
```

#### Greater Than or Equal To
```handlebars
{{ gte "a" "b" }}
```

#### Or
The `or` function lets you group chunks of logic together by checking if any of the included chunks are true.
```handlebars
{{#if (or 
        (eq section1 "foo")
        (ne section2 "bar"))}}
... content
{{/if}}
```

#### And
The `and` function lets you group chunks of logic together by checking if all of the included chunks are true.
```handlebars
{{#if (and 
        (eq section1 "foo")
        (ne section2 "bar"))}}
... content
{{/if}}
```

### Strings
#### Append
Appends the given `string` with the specified `suffix`.
```handlebars
{{ prepend "The word that means come after is" "append" }} // = `The word that means come after is append`

#### Number Format
Format a string given the provided criteria. This is useful for formatting a number so that it makes sense given the context or the users locale.

Format: `{{ numberFormat value locale style currency }}`
Parameters:
- `value`: The number to format
- `locale`: The users locale to display the number accordingly
- `style`: Either `currency` or `percent` or blank. Adding this parameter will modify the number to be displayed accordingly
- `currency`: You must set the `style` to `currency` for this to take effect. If set the currency symbol will be included in the formatted value.

Examples:
```handlebars
// Decimal
{{ numberFormat 123456.789 "de-DE" }} // = `123.456,789`
{{ numberFormat 123456.789 "en-US" }} // = `123,456.789`

// Percent
{{ numberFormat .41 "en" "percent" }} // = `41%`
```

### Lists
#### Wrap
