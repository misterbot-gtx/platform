# Campaigns

![Campaign Overview](/img/campaigns_overview.png)

## Overview
Campaigns are how all messaging happens within Parcelvoy. Whether that be sending an email blast or calling a webhook inside of a journey, all of that uses a campaign.

There are four basic channels that campaigns can be sent over:
- Email
- Text (SMS)
- Push Notification
- Webhook

The campaign handles scheduling, targeting and designing of a given communication and then passes the transmission over to a provider.

Dive deeper into the documentation for how to create, manage and launch campaigns.
