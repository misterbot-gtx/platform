# Journeys

![Journeys Overview](/img/journeys_overview.png)

## Overview
Journeys are configurable sequences of automated actions that help you add personalization to your communications. Think of journeys as putting your communications on auto-pilot. You can use journeys to send messages, update a user, perform actions on schedules and so much more! You can use journeys to build things like:

- Welcome experiences
- Level up notifications
- Cart abandonment sequences
- Special offers
- Recurring content messages
- Expiration notifications

At its core a journey is composed of `Steps`. You'll define how a user enters a journey through an `Entrance` step and then connect consecutive steps together using a simple visual editor. 

Dive deeper into the documentation for information about different components of journeys.
