# SMTP
You can use the SMTP integration to send emails over pretty much any email account out there.

:::caution
While it is super easy to use any inbox to send with SMTP, please note that most inboxes have low daily send limits. It's recommended that you use a provider meant for sending bulk or transactional emails.
